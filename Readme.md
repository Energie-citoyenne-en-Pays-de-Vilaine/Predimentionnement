# project presentation
this program is made for the ELFE project (Experimentons Localement la Flexibilite Energetique).

The project is a real-scale experiment where we try to maximize the efficiency of the local renewable energy by using it when availible, introducing "flexibility factors" by driving part of the consumption of volunteer citizens and professionals. It is based on the assumption that certain things can be delayed such as dishwashers, hot water tanks, freezers, ... without having a negative impact on the volunteer's life.

This is currently a program to evaluate the impact of some factors such as flexibility, storage, ... on electricity import/export.

This program use as it base an agglomerated open-data to make an average consumption for french "région Bretagne" and a Béganne windturbine as it source in order to simulate senarios to serve as a base for the next step, which is building the energy management system.

# energy producer

The energy producer is (at the moment) a citizen-owned wind farm composed of projects begawatts (Béganne), Isac-Watts (Sévérac-Guenrouët) and Tesdan le vent (Avessac)
Other sources may be incorporated as the project goes.

# convention
for the moment
all electric power will be expressed in Watt/200 users
all energy will be expressed in Watt.h/200 users
timestamps in files will be parsed to become dd/mm/yyyy:hh
